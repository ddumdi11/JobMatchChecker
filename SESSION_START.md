# SESSION START INSTRUCTIONS

Read and follow these rules STRICTLY for this entire session.

## 🔒 PROTECTED FILES - NEVER MODIFY WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL

These files control the build system. Changes can break the entire project.

**PROTECTED:**
- `package.json`
- `electron.vite.config.ts`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tsconfig.main.json`
- `knexfile.js`

**RULE:** If you think any protected file needs changes:
1. ❌ DO NOT modify it
2. 📋 Document WHY you think it needs changes
3. 🤝 Ask human for approval
4. ⏸️ STOP implementation until confirmed

## 🐛 DEBUGGING PROTOCOL

When encountering build errors:

### Step 1: Check Code Files FIRST
- Review recently changed `.ts` / `.tsx` files
- Check import paths
- Verify function signatures

### Step 2: Validate Configuration (only if code is correct)
```bash
npm run validate  # Run validation before assuming config issue
```

### Step 3: Never Guess
- ❌ DO NOT trial-and-error config changes
- ✅ ASK human before modifying any protected file
- ✅ Explain your reasoning before making changes

## 📁 PROJECT CONTEXT

Read these files at session start:
1. `PROJECT_RULES.md` - Project-specific rules
2. `specs/*/PLAN_SUMMARY.md` - Current implementation plan
3. `specs/*/TASKS_SUMMARY.txt` - Task list and status

## 🎯 CURRENT TASK

Before starting work:
1. Confirm which task you're implementing (e.g., "Starting T002?")
2. Read the task requirements
3. Verify dependencies are completed

## 🚫 PROCESS MANAGEMENT

**NEVER kill system processes yourself.**

❌ DO NOT use commands like:
- `taskkill` / `pkill` / `killall`
- `taskkill //IM node.exe` (kills yourself!)
- Any process termination commands

✅ INSTEAD:
- Ask human to restart processes
- Let human handle process cleanup
- Focus on code changes only

**Why?** You run inside a Node.js process. Killing Node processes kills you too.

## ⚠️ WHEN IN DOUBT

**ALWAYS ask instead of guessing.**

Examples:
- "Should I modify package.json to add X?"
- "The build fails - can I check electron.vite.config.ts?"
- "Task T005 seems to require changes to protected files - how should I proceed?"
- "Should I restart the dev server, or will you handle that?"

**Acknowledge these rules by saying:**
"✅ I've read SESSION_START.md and will follow all protection rules"
