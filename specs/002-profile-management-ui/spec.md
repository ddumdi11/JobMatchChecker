## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01

- Q: Skill Categories: Are skill categories predefined (from database seed) or can users create custom categories? → A: Hybrid (predefined categories available by default, but users can also create custom ones)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a job seeker, I need to create and maintain a comprehensive profile that includes my personal information, skills with proficiency levels, and job search preferences, so that the system can accurately match me with suitable job offers.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the application is launched for the first time, **When** the user accesses the profile section, **Then** they should be prompted to create their initial profile with mandatory fields (name, contact information)

2. **Given** a user profile exists, **When** the user adds a new skill, **Then** they must be able to:
   - Select or enter a skill name
   - Assign a proficiency level (0-10 scale)
   - Categorize the skill (e.g., Programming, Languages, Soft Skills)
   - Save the skill to their profile

3. **Given** a user has added skills, **When** they view their profile, **Then** all skills should be displayed grouped by category with their respective proficiency levels

4. **Given** a user wants to set job preferences, **When** they access the preferences section, **Then** they should be able to specify:
   - Desired salary range
   - Work location preferences (remote, on-site, hybrid)
   - Preferred locations/regions
   - Job type preferences (full-time, part-time, contract)
   - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What other preferences are needed? Industry, company size, benefits?]

5. **Given** a user has completed their profile, **When** they update any information, **Then** the changes should be saved and reflected immediately in the profile view

6. **Given** a user has an existing profile, **When** they want to review their information, **Then** they should see a clear, organized display of all profile data including personal info, skills, and preferences

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to add a duplicate skill?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should duplicates be prevented, merged, or allowed?]

- What happens when a user sets an invalid salary range (e.g., minimum > maximum)?
  - System MUST validate and provide clear error messages

- What happens when a user leaves mandatory fields empty?
  - System MUST prevent saving incomplete profiles and highlight missing fields

- What happens when a skill proficiency level is set outside the 0-10 range?
  - System MUST enforce valid range constraints

- What happens if the user wants to delete their entire profile?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should profile deletion be allowed? What are the implications for existing job matches?]
