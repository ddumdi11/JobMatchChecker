## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a desktop application user, I need a persistent navigation sidebar to quickly switch between the main sections of the application (Dashboard, My Profile, Job Listings, and Settings) without losing my current work or context.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is open on any page, **When** I click on "Dashboard" in the sidebar, **Then** the dashboard page displays without browser navigation controls
2. **Given** the app is open on the Dashboard, **When** I click on "Profile" in the sidebar, **Then** the profile management page displays
3. **Given** the app is open on any page, **When** I click on "Jobs" in the sidebar, **Then** the job listings page displays
4. **Given** the app is open on any page, **When** I click on "Settings" in the sidebar, **Then** the settings page displays
5. **Given** I am viewing any page, **When** I look at the sidebar, **Then** the current page is visually highlighted with a colored background and emphasized icon

### Edge Cases

- What happens when navigation occurs while unsaved changes exist on current page? ‚Üí System shows confirmation dialog asking to save/discard/cancel
- How does the sidebar behave on different window sizes? ‚Üí Fixed width sidebar with vertical scroll if window height is small
- What happens if a user tries to navigate to a page they don't have access to? ‚Üí Not applicable (single-user app, all pages accessible)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a persistent sidebar visible on all main application pages
- **FR-002**: Sidebar MUST display navigation links for Dashboard, Profile, Jobs, and Settings pages
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to navigate between pages by clicking sidebar items
- **FR-004**: Navigation MUST occur without displaying browser address bar or navigation controls (native Electron app behavior)
- **FR-005**: System MUST visually highlight the currently active page in the sidebar with colored background and emphasized icon
- **FR-006**: Sidebar MUST use Material-UI design components and styling
- **FR-007**: Sidebar MUST have fixed width and remain always visible (not collapsible in v1)
- **FR-008**: System MUST show confirmation dialog when user navigates away from a page with unsaved changes, offering options to save, discard, or cancel
- **FR-009**: Sidebar MUST use fixed width layout with vertical scroll capability for small window heights
- **FR-010**: Application MUST start on Dashboard page by default (no navigation state persistence in v1)

### Key Entities
