# Feature Specification: Job Offer Management

**Feature Branch**: `005-job-offer-management`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Job Offer Management: Als Nutzer m√∂chte ich Jobs verwalten k√∂nnen. Ich brauche eine Job-Liste unter /jobs die alle meine erfassten Stellenangebote zeigt. Die Liste soll filterbar sein nach Status (new, interesting, applied, rejected, archived), nach Jobb√∂rse, nach Datum und nach Match-Score. Ich m√∂chte Jobs manuell hinzuf√ºgen, bearbeiten und l√∂schen k√∂nnen. Beim Hinzuf√ºgen m√∂chte ich entweder alle Felder manuell ausf√ºllen oder einen Job-Text per Copy-Paste einf√ºgen, den die AI dann automatisch in die Felder extrahiert (Titel, Firma, Standort, Gehalt, Remote-Option, Anforderungen etc.). Die Job-Detail-Ansicht unter /jobs/:id existiert bereits und zeigt alle Informationen an. Jobs haben folgende Felder: Titel (Pflicht), Firma (Pflicht), URL, Datum (Pflicht), Deadline, Standort, Remote-Option, Gehaltsrange, Vertragsart, Volltext, Status, Notizen. Der Volltext enth√§lt alle Job-Anforderungen die sp√§ter per AI mit meinen Skills abgeglichen werden. F√ºr Phase 1 reicht es wenn Requirements im Volltext bleiben, strukturierte job_requirements Tabelle kommt sp√§ter in Phase 2."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-14

- Q: Wenn mehrere Filter gleichzeitig aktiv sind, wie sollen diese kombiniert werden? ‚Üí A: AND-Logik - Jobs m√ºssen ALLE Kriterien erf√ºllen
- Q: Wenn die AI nicht alle Pflichtfelder extrahieren kann, wie soll das System reagieren? ‚Üí A: Partial Pre-fill mit Warnung - Felder vorausf√ºllen soweit m√∂glich, fehlende Pflichtfelder rot markieren, User muss manuell nachtragen
- Q: Pagination oder Infinite Scroll bei vielen Jobs? ‚Üí A: Pagination mit 25 Jobs pro Seite
- Q: Filter/Sort-Einstellungen zwischen Sitzungen speichern oder zur√ºcksetzen? ‚Üí A: Zur√ºcksetzen bei jedem Start - Immer Standardansicht (Posted Date newest first, keine Filter)
- Q: Job-L√∂schung mit bestehenden Matching-Ergebnissen? ‚Üí A: Cascade Delete - Job und alle verkn√ºpften Matching-Ergebnisse automatisch l√∂schen

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a job seeker, I want to efficiently manage all my job applications in one place, so that I can track my progress, filter opportunities by relevance, and make data-driven decisions about which positions to pursue.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: View Job List
1. **Given** I have previously saved 15 job offers in the system
2. **When** I navigate to `/jobs`
3. **Then** I see a list/table showing all 15 jobs with key information (title, company, status, posted date, match score if available)
4. **And** the list is sorted by posted date (newest first) by default

#### Scenario 2: Filter Jobs by Status
1. **Given** I am on the job list page with 15 jobs in various states
2. **When** I select "applied" from the status filter
3. **Then** the list updates to show only jobs with status "applied"
4. **And** the count displays "Showing 3 of 15 jobs"

#### Scenario 3: Add Job via AI-Assisted Copy-Paste
1. **Given** I found an interesting job posting on a job board
2. **When** I click "Add Job" and select "Paste Job Text"
3. **And** I paste the complete job description text
4. **And** I click "Extract with AI"
5. **Then** the system sends the text to AI for field extraction
6. **And** the form fields are pre-filled with extracted data (title, company, location, salary, etc.)
7. **And** I can review and edit any field before saving
8. **When** I click "Save"
9. **Then** the new job appears in my job list with status "new"

#### Scenario 4: Add Job Manually
1. **Given** I want to add a job without AI assistance
2. **When** I click "Add Job" and select "Manual Entry"
3. **Then** I see an empty form with all job fields
4. **When** I fill in required fields (title, company, posted date) and select a job source
5. **And** I click "Save"
6. **Then** the job is added to my list
7. **And** I see a success message

#### Scenario 5: Edit Existing Job
1. **Given** I am viewing a job detail page
2. **When** I click "Edit"
3. **Then** I see an editable form with all current job data
4. **When** I change the status from "new" to "applied"
5. **And** I add a note "Applied on 2025-10-14 via company website"
6. **And** I click "Save"
7. **Then** the job is updated with my changes
8. **And** I am redirected to the updated job detail view

#### Scenario 6: Delete Job
1. **Given** I am viewing a job I no longer want to track
2. **When** I click "Delete Job"
3. **Then** I see a confirmation dialog "Are you sure you want to delete this job? This action cannot be undone."
4. **When** I confirm deletion
5. **Then** the job is removed from the system
6. **And** I am redirected to the job list

#### Scenario 7: Combine Multiple Filters
1. **Given** I have 50 jobs from various sources
2. **When** I filter by status "interesting" AND source "LinkedIn" AND posted date "Last 7 days"
3. **Then** I see only jobs matching ALL selected criteria
4. **And** the count shows "Showing 4 of 50 jobs"

#### Scenario 8: Sort by Different Columns
1. **Given** I am viewing my job list
2. **When** I click the "Company" column header
3. **Then** the list re-sorts alphabetically by company name (A-Z)
4. **When** I click the "Company" header again
5. **Then** the sort order reverses (Z-A)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when AI extraction fails to identify required fields (title, company, date)?
- What if the pasted text is too short or not job-related?
- How does the system handle duplicate jobs (same title + company + URL)?
- What if match score is not yet available (job not yet matched)?
- What happens when user tries to save a job without filling required fields?
- How does the system behave when all filters are applied but no jobs match?
- What if user deletes a job that has associated matching results?
- Can user cancel out of the delete confirmation?
- What if the job source dropdown is empty (no sources configured)?

  - **Optional**: URL, Deadline, Location, Remote Option, Salary Range, Contract Type, Full Text, Status, Notes
  - **System-generated**: Created At, Updated At
- **Relationships**: Belongs to one Job Source, may have multiple Matching Results (future feature)
- **Lifecycle**: Created (status: new) ‚Üí Updated (status changes) ‚Üí Deleted (permanent removal)

#### Job Source
- **Purpose**: Represents job boards or platforms where jobs are found (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, company website)
- **Note**: This entity already exists in the database and is managed separately
- **Relationship**: One source has many job offers
