# Implementation Plan: Profile Management UI

**Branch**: `001-profile-management-ui` | **Date**: 2025-10-21 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-profile-management-ui/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Create a user profile management UI for a desktop job matching application that allows job seekers to:

- Manage personal information (name, email, location) with auto-save after 2s
- Add/edit/delete up to 500 skills with proficiency levels (0-10) and categories
- Set job preferences including salary range and remote work percentage range
- View profile completion indicator
- Delete profile with confirmation

Technical approach: Electron desktop app with React UI, Material-UI components, Zustand state management, and SQLite database via Knex migrations. Already partially implemented (T001-T011A complete), this plan focuses on completing the state management integration and ensuring all requirements are met.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3 / Node.js 18+ (Electron 38.2.1)
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18.2, Material-UI 5.15, Zustand 4.5, better-sqlite3 12.4, Knex 3.1
**Storage**: SQLite (embedded, local via better-sqlite3)
**Testing**: Vitest (unit + integration tests)
**Target Platform**: Windows/macOS/Linux Desktop (Electron)
**Project Type**: Electron desktop (main process + renderer process architecture)
**Performance Goals**: Auto-save debounce 2s, UI response <100ms, max 500 skills per profile
**Constraints**: Local-only data (no cloud sync), single-user app, offline-capable
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop application, ~10-15 React components, 4 database tables

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Constitutional Principles Compliance

**✅ Privacy First**

- All data stored locally in SQLite database (no cloud sync)
- No external API calls for this feature
- User data deletion implemented (FR-011)

**✅ Datenintegrität**

- Database migrations via Knex.js (already established in project)
- Backup mechanism exists (Feature 004 - Database Backup & Restore)
- Validation rules prevent invalid data (salary range, remote range, skill limits)

**✅ Adaptivität**

- Skill categories extensible (7 predefined + unlimited custom)
- Skill levels 0-10 with semantic mapping (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert)
- Profile fields mostly optional (only first name + last name required)

**✅ Transparenz**

- Clear validation messages for users
- Profile completion indicator shows progress
- Unsaved changes warnings prevent data loss

**✅ Iterative Entwicklung**

- Feature builds on existing infrastructure (T001-T011A already complete)
- Incremental implementation (components → integration → polish)
- Backward compatible with existing database schema

**✅ Tech Constraints**

- Uses established stack: Electron + React + Material-UI + SQLite
- Follows existing patterns (Knex migrations, better-sqlite3)
- No new runtime dependencies introduced

### Gate Result: **PASS** ✅

No constitutional violations detected. Feature aligns with all core principles.

**Structure Decision**: Electron application with separate main (Node.js) and renderer (React) processes. Profile Management UI components live in `src/renderer/components/` and `src/renderer/pages/`. State management via Zustand store in `src/renderer/store/`. Database access via `src/main/database/` with IPC bridge in `src/main/ipc/handlers.ts`.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

**Status**: ✅ **SKIPPED** - No unknowns detected

**Analysis**:

- ✅ All technology choices already established (TypeScript, React, Material-UI, Zustand, SQLite)
- ✅ Project structure already exists and is consistent
- ✅ Database migration patterns already in use (Knex.js)
- ✅ IPC communication patterns already established
- ✅ Testing framework already configured (Vitest)

**Rationale for skipping**:

This feature builds on existing, proven infrastructure (T001-T011A already completed). The technical stack, patterns, and architecture are well-established. No research or technology selection is needed - this is purely an incremental feature addition to an existing codebase.

**Output**: No research.md file needed (no NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers present)

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

*Prerequisites: Phase 0 complete (skipped)*

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Completed Deliverables

1. ✅ **data-model.md** - Entity definitions and validation rules
   - 4 entities: UserProfile, Skill, SkillCategory, UserPreferences
   - Validation rules from FR-001 through FR-011
   - Relationships and constraints defined

2. ✅ **contracts/ipc-channels.md** - IPC communication contracts
   - 9 IPC channels (PROFILE_*, SKILLS_*, PREFERENCES_*)
   - TypeScript schemas for request/response
   - Validation rules and error cases

3. ✅ **quickstart.md** - Manual validation scenarios
   - 10 manual test scenarios from acceptance criteria
   - Integration test flow
   - Performance validation

4. ✅ **CLAUDE.md updated** - Agent context
   - TypeScript 5.3 / Electron 38.2.1
   - React 18.2, Material-UI 5.15, Zustand 4.5
   - Feature 001 context integrated

**Output**: data-model.md ✅, contracts/ipc-channels.md ✅, quickstart.md ✅, CLAUDE.md ✅

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY COMPLETE** (tasks.md pre-exists)

**Current State**: tasks.md already exists with T001-T016 defined and partially implemented:
- T001-T010: Database & IPC infrastructure (COMPLETE)
- T011A: Zustand store creation (COMPLETE)
- T011B: Component integration (IN PROGRESS - 1/4 done)
- T012-T016: UI components (COMPLETE)

**Task Generation Strategy** (if /tasks were to run):
- Validate existing tasks against Phase 1 design docs (contracts/ipc-channels.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md)
- Ensure all 8 IPC channels from contracts have corresponding tests
- Verify all 4 entities from data-model.md have validation coverage
- Map quickstart.md scenarios to integration tests
- Add missing test tasks if gaps found

**Ordering Strategy** (already applied in existing tasks.md):
- ✅ TDD order: Tests before implementation
- ✅ Dependency order: Models → Services → IPC → Store → UI
- ✅ Parallel markers [P] for independent file operations

**Output**: Existing tasks.md (16 tasks) aligns with Phase 1 design

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan. Since tasks.md already exists and is well-structured, /tasks would perform validation rather than generation.

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
